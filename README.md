### CorAlive is a lightweight plugin which prevents coral blocks placed outside of water from dying.

Since this means coral blocks can't be turned into their respective dead variants the plugin adds the option to add crafting recipes. The two config options and their default values are the following:
```yaml
enable-recipes: true
enable-reverse-recipes: false
```

"enable-recipes" adds crafting recipes to turn living coral blocks into their dead variants, while "enable-reverse-recipes" adds recipes that allow the player to turn already dead coral blocks back into their respective living variants.

### Turning any of these config options off after they had been enabled for a while will spam the console with messages of joining players having unrecognised recipes. These messages can be ignored.
